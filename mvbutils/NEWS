11/12/2021, 2.3,384: added health warnings to 'mlazy' doco re 'environment' objects

14/1/2022, 2.8.387: 'mdeparse' for better deparsing of ':=' and '?'; workaround for bug in 'utils::isS3method' that was blowing up 'update_loaded_packages'

27/7/2023: added 'mvb_session_env()' and dottonym to ultimately replace the 'mvb.session.info' search-path environment. I'll gradually change stuff in 'mvbutils' to refer to this instead.

3/3/2024: finally moved 'numvbderiv' and 'numvbderiv_parallel' in here (and changed names) out of 'handy2'. Thus added 2 packages to 'Suggests.
